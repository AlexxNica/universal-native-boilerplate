# Universal Native Boilerplate

It's possible to share the majority of a frontend codebase across platforms. Build a native rendered app for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, web, and server-side rendering using React and React Native.

This boilerplate is meant to be a fairly non-opinionated starting place for devs who want to build an app that compiles for many native targets and shares the majority of its codebase.

## Quick Start

### Installation
1. Download the boilerplate code:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/c-h-/universal-native-boilerplate.git my-app
cd my-app

```

2. If you have yarn: `yarn install`, otherwise: `npm install`

3. Configure git properly: `npm run setup`

4. Configure the new package properly: `npm init`
